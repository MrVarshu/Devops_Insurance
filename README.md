# Usage-Based Insurance System

## Project Overview

This project implements a modular usage-based insurance system that analyzes driving behavior data collected via telematics to offer dynamic insurance pricing and personalized safety recommendations.

The system processes raw telematics data (speed, acceleration, braking, time of day, road type), analyzes driving behavior patterns, assesses risk, adjusts insurance premiums accordingly, and generates actionable feedback to encourage safer driving.

## Development Workflow

1. **Created GitHub Repository:**  
   A new repository was created on GitHub to host and version-control the project code remotely.

2. **Developed Locally in VS Code:**  
   The codebase was developed using Visual Studio Code. The system was implemented with modular Python scripts that separate concerns into data collection, behavior analysis, risk scoring, pricing adjustment, and feedback generation.

3. **Pushed Code to GitHub:**  
   Git was initialized locally, changes were committed, and the local repository was linked to the GitHub remote. The full codebase was then pushed to GitHub, enabling collaboration and remote storage.

## Code Structure and Modules

The project is organized into the following key modules:

- **data_collection.py:** Collects and stores telematics driving data such as speed, acceleration, braking, time of day, and road type.

- **behavior_analysis.py:** Analyzes collected data to identify risky driving patterns and computes an aggregate risk factor.

- **risk_scoring.py:** Converts the risk factor into a numerical risk score used for premium calculation.

- **pricing_adjustment.py:** Adjusts the base insurance premium dynamically based on the computed risk score.

- **feedback_system.py:** Generates personalized safety recommendations aimed at improving driving behavior.

- **main.py:** Orchestrates the entire data pipeline by sequentially calling each module to process telematics data from collection through to feedback.

## Workflow Pipeline

The system follows a clear and modular pipeline:

1. **Telematics Data Collection:** Raw driving data is collected, representing multiple driving events.

2. **Behavior Analysis:** The collected data is analyzed to detect risky patterns (e.g., speeding, harsh braking).

3. **Risk Assessment:** A risk factor is computed and translated into a risk score reflecting overall driving safety.

4. **Pricing Adjustment:** The insurance premium is adjusted according to the risk score, incentivizing safer driving.

5. **Feedback Generation:** Safety insights and recommendations are generated based on driving behavior to help the driver improve.
